# Security - credentials, API keys, etc.
# It's better to manage secrets outside of version control.
# For example, use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management tool.
# If you have specific files for secrets, add them here, e.g.:
# secrets.ini
# credentials.json
# .env # (already listed in Environments, but good to re-iterate its purpose for secrets)
